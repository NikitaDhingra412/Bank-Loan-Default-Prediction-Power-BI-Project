# Bank Loan Default Prediction & Financial Analysis — Power BI & SQL Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan performance and predicting default risk using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI. It covers the complete Business Intelligence cycle: data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboard creation. The goal is to help financial institutions identify high-risk loans and make better lending decisions using data-driven insights.
